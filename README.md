// Peer Review: Isaias Gonzalez - The welcome section, package section, and amenities section are missing text. The welcome section has some awkward responsiveness. The amenities section background image repeats at wider screen sizes. The reserve section form fields are not responsive, so they look squashed on smaller screens. The responsiveness you have for the our room section, package section, and amenities section is done well, good job.
